# Nexa Talk

This is a client for the service nexa-talk, as a part of the Graduate project for my bachelor's degree in Computer
Science.

It is a web application that allows users manage a dashboard with the calls and transcriptions made by AI. The
application is built using Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
